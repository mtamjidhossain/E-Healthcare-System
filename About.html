			<h1><b>Easy Access to Top-Quality Cancer Care in Central New Jersey</b></h1>
			<p>At Regional Cancer Care Associates’ Central Jersey, our approach to treating cancer is to dedicate ourselves to your needs. 
			A vital part of this longstanding commitment is making it easy for you or your loved one to get our experienced, leading-edge care and
			delivering it with the efficiency and support you need.</p>
			<h2>Six convenient locations to serve you in Central NJ.</h2>
			<p>If you have cancer, you needn’t leave Central NJ to get the quality care and leading-edge protocols and standards that represent the 
			best of modern cancer (and hematology) treatment. At RCCA-CJ, we have six convenient locations around the region — in East Brunswick, 
			Edison, Hamiltons, Monroe Township, Somerset and Somerville. At these locations, we provide not just advanced, experienced care but also 
			the uniquely local, dedicated, individualized care that sets us apart from the “satellite” offices of much larger and less nimble providers. 
			Our specialists also work out of multiple hospitals in and around these communities.</p>
			<h3>Greater seamlessness of care and access to specialized expertise.</h3>
			<p>In addition to offering medical oncology care at several locations, we also offer multiple locations for radiation treatment as a result of our merger
			with Princeton Radiation Oncology (PRO). Combined with PRO, we offer more comprehensive care and greater seamlessness to treat all types of cancer. 
			This takes our hallmark accessibility to an even higher level, making it easy to get to the care you need and increasing your ability to increasing your
			access to doctors with noted expertise in a variety of cancers.</p>
			<h4>Get in fast for the advanced cancer care you depend on.</h4>
			<p>Getting seen quickly at a conveniently located facility is not all there is to accessible care. Communication is of course vitally important. The patient,
			doctors and staff must be able to communicate. This is particularly important in Central New Jersey, where the communities RCCA-CJ serves are ethnically 
			and culturally — and therefore linguistically — diverse. Our team is very representative of this diversity, which means that we can communicate with patients
			and their families in many different languages, including:

<li>English</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Portuguese</li>
<li>Mandarin Chinese</li>
<li>Romanian</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>Punjabi</li>

<li>Gujarati</li>
For more information, or to schedule an appointment with one of RCCA-CJ’s experienced, caring cancer specialists, call <u>888-824-8312</u> 
You can also request an appointment using our easy online form.</p>
